        What is your process for testing websites before launch?
      </h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Our websites are thoroughly examined in our testing environment. We check that your website is responsive across
        devices and passes our development standards. At this stage, you will have the opportunity to interact with your
        website, provide input and request changes.

      <span class="cs-topper">Accessibility</span>
      <h2 class="cs-title">
        What is web accessibility and why is it important for my website?
      </h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Web accessibility is crucial because it enables people with varying abilities to freely access your
        website. Ignoring web accessibility standards restricts people with visual, auditory,
        motor and other impairments from accessing your website.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2 class="cs-title">
        How do you ensure that websites are accessible to people with
        disabilities?
      </h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        We adhere to WCAG 2.0 accessibility guidelines. Throughout the design phase, we place a
        strong emphasis on legibility of fonts, high contrast between elements and creating a uniform layout with a
        distinct header hierarchy. In the development phase, we craft purposeful alt-text for images and descriptive
        text for links, ensure keyboard accessibility and provide clear labels and instructions for form
        fields.<br><br>We endeavour to stay updated on emerging accessibility standards and make all necessary updates
        to ensure continued compliance.
